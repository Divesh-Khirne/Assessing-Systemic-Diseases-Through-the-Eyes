This repository presents a deep learning-based framework for automated diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection using both fundus and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. The study leverages the complementary nature of these two modalities—fundus imaging provides vascular patterns, while OCT captures retinal layer structures—to improve diagnostic accuracy and reliability. A ResNet18-based multimodal fusion network was developed, combining feature-level representations from both sources for final classification. The dataset, comprising 1,548 fundus and 1,113 OCT images, was organized patient-wise and split into training, validation, and test sets. Experimental results demonstrated that the multimodal fusion model achieved a 94.00% accuracy, outperforming single-modality models (93.51% for fundus-only and 89.50% for OCT-only). The proposed approach provides an efficient, automated, and scalable solution that can assist ophthalmologists in the early detection and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, potentially reducing the global burden of vision loss.
